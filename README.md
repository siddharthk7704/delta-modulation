# delta-modulation
This project is dedicated to the Digital Communication course.
This code can record your own voice in real-time and perform delta modulation on it.

In this, you can choose the duration of your voice recording and choose the step size for the modulation.
After this, it will plot the original & modulated version of the message signal (which is your recorded voice in this). You can zoom into the modulated signal to see how delta modulation is taking place. It also plots the quantization error signal to understand at which instances the error is maximum.

It also saves the modulated signal in mp3 format.

Python libraries required for this:
1. pydub (For audio processing and manipulation)
2. numpy (For numerical computing in Python)
3. matplotlib (For plotting the signals)
4. scipy (For scientific computing and technical computing)
5. sounddevice (For recording and playing audio)
